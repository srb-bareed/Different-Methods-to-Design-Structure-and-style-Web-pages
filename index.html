                   <p>Web Developers, rarely use a single method or technique to structure and style web-pages. They choose all the techniques to style the pages just not on 
                    their relevance and effectiveness, but also on convenience.</p>
                    <p>In this experimental project I have tried to code a single design several times adhering to a single technique each time. In practical development, rarely or 
                    perhaps no one design entire website using just single method like CSS float, or CSS position to develop the entire site. But, in this project I have 
                    successfully tried to do so. Meanwhile, by doing so I have just not gained more knowledge about each technique, but also I learned how to solve a single 
                    problem in many different ways.</p>
